# GHG-Emission-Analysis-
Analysis of GHG emission specially Co2 tell us about the amount of gas emitted in atmosphere by different state and countries. Using different visualization tools and algorithm that make our prediction task 
easier.Its helps us to get to know about which country have more contribution in GHG emission and also tells us that those particular region need to be more take care.

In this repositry,I also mention about 'Carbon Marketing and Role of AI', how they correlate with each other.:-

My outcomes from this project mentioned below that might be help a country for safe and pure environment:-
1.It is easy to find carbon emission in particular area by knowing the purchase of carbon credit in an area and also which company more credited with one another.
More Carbon Credit Purchase====More Carbon Emission

2.If we make the co2 detection system(as per example of live weather forecasting by getting live API) then we can easily predict carbon emissions in particular area...
 [Based examples:-daily temperature ,upcoming cyclone(earthquake).]

3.Best algo for carbon emission anaylsis(random forest,k means clustering,ANN)
